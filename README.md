This project was done for 'Creative Electronics', a Beng Electronics Engineering 4th year module at the University of MÃ¡laga, School of Telecommunications. (www.etsit.uma.es).

This project is a bulb with Bluetooth communication that can change colour brightness and create special effects with lights powered by 2 Neopixel Rings, it also has the possibility to connect a external sensor to measure outside parameters like temperature, humidity, move...

And a special fact, that is quite important nowadays, is that it onlyconsumes around 4W a maximum in white and with maximum luminosity.

Every parameter is controlled by an Android APP, that shows:

The mesure of the humidity and the temperature of the room in which the bulb is
Change the colour of the bulb.
To Program the default colour of the bulb that is an option if you want to use like a regular bulb.
Special lights effects , like an Aurora, light of a candle or random colors every 5 sec.
All the circuits are embedded in a regular bulb of 15W of which I only used the body.
